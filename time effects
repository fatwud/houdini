// For looping a given number of frames with a time shift node.
// Set the timeshift to Clamp to first
// In the frame parameter use the following expression, where n is the desired time to loop, say on frame 24 use 24 as the value.
($F-1) % n + 1
// The + 1 is so that way the value doesn't return 0, and reference the 0th frame.
// The - 1 is to ensure that the first frame isn't read as 2.
